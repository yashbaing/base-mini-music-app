# Audio Files

The audio files are not included in this repository because they exceed GitHub's file size limit (100MB per file).

## Adding Audio Files

To use this app, place your audio files in the `public/audio/` directory:

```
public/audio/
  ├── Panipat by Ninad Bedekar Sir Ep_01.mp3
  ├── Panipat by Ninad Bedekar Sir Ep_02.mp3
  ├── Panipat by Ninad Bedekar Sir Ep_03.mp3
  └── Shivcharitra by Ninad Bedekar Sir Ep_01.mp3
```

The app will automatically discover and load audio files from this directory.

## File Size Limits

- GitHub limit: 100MB per file
- Recommended: Keep files under 50MB for better performance

## Alternative Storage Options

If you need to share audio files:

1. **Git LFS** (Git Large File Storage) - For version control
2. **Cloud Storage** (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.) - Host files separately
3. **CDN** - Use a content delivery network for audio files
4. **IPFS** - Decentralized storage for Web3 apps

For local development, just place the files in `public/audio/` directory.
